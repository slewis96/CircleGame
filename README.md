<span style="color:#c20000;font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">Summary</span>
---
Click on the circle as soon as it appears miss then **gameover** don't click in time then **gameover**
More successful clicks means a smaller target, a shorter time to click but also an increased score<br>

---
Desktop users:  

* I recommend using a mouse for a better experience (If you are really good with a trackpad then you are better than me and feel free to use that)  

* It's also important to note the smaller the screen the easier time you will have so resize the circle accordingly (Hopefully we can implement some changes to automatically do this at somepoint)

Mobile users:

* The circles become quite small on mobile which may hinder your experience so settings "Fix Size" toggle on is recommended.

---
I enjoyed implementing this project and I am happy with the way I tackled the implementation. I tried to implement the basic game in a way where it would be simple to add the features after; although I did this fairly successfully when it came to implementing the new game mode I ran into some issues with the way the game was implemented. As I was having problems with adding the new game mode how I had originally intended I decided to change my intentions for the game mode; I swapped the name of the game mode from mania to juggle and scored the player on different criteria.  

Other than this game mode wall I hit during development everything else went pretty smoothly due to planning everything about the game (including how to implement it) in my head and then jotting down my ideas as notes. Having a good idea of how to go about things meant when I started implementation I knew exactly what I was doing. In the future I will be ensuring I think further about any stretch goals (like the new gamemode) before defining how I will be implementing the initial the project as to account for additions I will make on a later date.

* Nearing the end of the project I had wanted to add a mode for the circle moving in a random direction on spawn due to time restraints this however wasn't implemented

* The clearness of all the functionality availble on the game was also something that I intend to improve based on feedback received

* The difference for users on different monitor sizes and resolutions is something that I hope to improve in the future
